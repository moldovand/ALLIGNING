# ALLIGNING RANDOM SETS OF POINT CLOUDS GENERATED BY A 3D/2D CAPTURING SYSTEM (IN THIS CASE A LASER SCANNER FITTED WITH A CAMERA)
Previous works that implemented an automatic registration of multiple depth images have used the detection of corresponding 3D point pairs in order to calculate the relative orientations. False 3D correspondences were detected by checking their compliance with the parameters of the mathematical model of the orientation calculated in 3D space. 
In this code I have introduced a new method of detecting correct 3D correspondences that initially eliminate false correspondences in 2D space. Subsequently, the 3D correspondences are detected by using the one-to-one correspondence between the 3D points and the corresponding projections in the image provided by the scanner. 
Due to its ability to detect corresponding 3D points in a fast way, the presented method is suitable for applications characterized by a fast, full 3D model reconstruction of structured objects.
